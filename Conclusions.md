# Conclusion and Discussions

## Model Evaluation
Both the content-based and collaborative filtering models had fairly high training and test scores with their respective datasets. In terms of which model performed better, the predictions in the collaborative filtering model were not as similar to those made by the content-based model. In fact, the content-based model was able to produce very accurate predictions, which was surprising given that it only used about 60k songs.

For the reader's convenience, we generated some predictions for a subset of the playlists in the dataset and aggregated the links to the songs in the tables below.

### Rap Music

The content-based model performed really well on rap music. This is probably because rap music is fairly distinct as a genre: high speechiness yet fairly high danceability as well.
